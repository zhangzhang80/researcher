## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="zhangzhang.jpg">

I received the PhD degree from [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://nlpr.ia.ac.cn), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.ac.cn/) in 2009 under the supervision of [Prof. Tieniu Tan](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/CN/column/item83.shtml). From 2009 to 2010, I was a research fellow working with [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dacheng.tao.php) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In September 2010, I joined the NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA). In 2019, I worked as a visiting researcher under the direction of [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Now, I am an Associate Professor at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/) and NLPR, CASIA.

## Research Interests

My research field is computer vision and pattern recognition. The main research interests include human action and activity recognition, human attribute recognition, person re-identification, and large-scale person retrieval.
