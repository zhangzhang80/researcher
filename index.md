## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="zhangzhang.jpg">

I received the PhD degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.ac.cn/) in 2009 under the supervision of Prof. Tieniu Tan. From 2009 to 2010, I was a research fellow working with Prof. Dacheng Tao at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In September 2010, I joined the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/CN/model/index.shtml), CASIA. Currently, I am an Associate Professor at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/). 

Since Dec. 2018, I am working as a visiting researcher under the direction of Prof. Song-Chun Zhu's in the [Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy (VCLA) lab](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 


## Research Interests

My research field is computer vision and pattern recognition. The main research interests include human action and activity recognition, human attribute recognition, person re-identification, and large-scale person retrieval.
